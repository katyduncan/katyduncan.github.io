      I am currently a Dev Bootcamp student, working each week on harnessing new web development/programming/coding/engineering skills. Please feel free to reach out to me with any tips or feedback as I work to expand my knowledge across these areas. Throughout my training I will continue to incorporate updates to this site. I post weekly tech and cultural blogs that are linked to this site and I'm currently using GitHub to store all of my projects (I post notifications about project and blog updates via twitter). Thanks for checking out my website!

      About me:
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up all over the country (South Carolina, Oklahoma, New Hampshire) but just moved to my birthplace, Palo Alto, from Chicago. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Math and worked for a couple years as an analyst at a consulting firm. I then was presented with an opportunity to pursue professional ballet (which I had dreamt of and trained for since I was four years old) that I couldn't turn down, and so I've spent the past few years dancing professionally. In college I got a small taste of computer science and really enjoyed it and since then I've always wanted to find time to more fully immerse myself in the field and see how I could translate my academic knowledge of coding and my analytical skills into real world applications. Luckily I heard about Dev Bootcamp and it has thus far been exactly what I was hoping for! Check out my blogs, portfolio tab, and github site to track my progress and latest projects.
