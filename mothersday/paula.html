      About this site:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a Dev Bootcamp student, working each week on harnessing new web development/programming/coding/engineering skills. Please feel free to reach out to me with any tips or feedback as I work to expand my knowledge across these areas. Throughout my training I will continue to incorporate updates to this site. I post weekly tech and cultural blogs that are linked to this site and I'm currently using GitHub to store all of my projects (I post notifications about project and blog updates via twitter). Thanks for checking out my website!

    <p>
     Katy Duncan is a fullstack web developer and a general tech enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating from the University of Chicago with a bachelor's in Math, she worked in finance for a couple of years in Chicago before getting an opportunity dance ballet professionally. Throughout her life she had maintained a personal interest in computer programming, dabbled in a few computer sciences classes in college, and continued to imagine that one day she would find herself an active participant in the tech world. After moving to Palo Alto, CA she found herself in the land of opportunity and could not stand to wait in the sidelines any longer. Since completing an extremely intense and rigorous web development bootcamp/training program she has been thrilled to be able to explore her passion in programming, software engineering, and web development. Her current languages/technologies of choice are Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Python, but she continues to learn about and explore new languages as often as possible.
