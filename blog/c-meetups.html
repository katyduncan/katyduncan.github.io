        I have officially graduated from DBC! I'm out on my own in the real world now. Well, not entirely alone. I'm incredibly thankful to the careers team and all the support they offer to alumni. Through DBC's career week I've learned so many things.

        One of my favorite things about the tech community that I experienced during my time at DBC is that nearly everything is open source. And I’ve been so thrilled to see that the approach to sharing insights and findings is just as prevalent outside of DBC’s walls. Open source’s success feeds on enthusiasm for the industry and a process of spontaneous discovery through people’s shared wealth of knowledge. This process is intrinsically informal.

        Indeed, a major point that our career coaches made was the fact that a majority of job positions are not advertised. I think this speaks to the fact that the barriers between members of the community and private company positions are very informal. And so the best way to not only hear about job opportunities, but also to better understand the industry environment, stay current, and hear about new tech is through discussion with peers. Outside of the classroom this scales to networking at events, meeting new people in the field who share your interests, attending talks/seminars/events, and volunteering to share your own knowledge with others.

        There are some great organizations out there, and everyone wants to share what they know! There aren’t barriers between competitors or possessive secrecy issues. Spreading the knowledge is contagious, inspiring, and fun. I’m so excited to have already been so quickly welcomed in this community and to continue to be an active member and contributor.
