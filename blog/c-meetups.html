        I have officially graduated from DBC! I'm out on my own in the real world now. Well, not entirely alone. I'm incredibly thankful to the careers team and all the support they offer to alumns. Through DBC's career week I've learned so many things, including the fact that a majority of job positions are not advertised. The best way to not only hear about job opportunities, but also to better understand the tech environment, stay current, and hear about new tech is through discussion with peers. Outside of the classroom this scales to networking at events, meeting new people in the field who share your interests, attending talks/seminars/events, and volunteering to share your own knowledge with others.

        There are some great organizations out there, and everyone wants to share what they know! There aren’t barriers between competitors or possessive secrecy issues. Spreading the knowledge is contagious, inspiring, and fun. I’m so excited to have already been so quickly welcomed in this community and to continue to be an active member and contributor to the tech community.
