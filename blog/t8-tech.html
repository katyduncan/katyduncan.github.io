        Big O notation refers to a way to estimate how much time or space a program will require to run. We spend so long fine-tuning our detail-oriented technical skills and mastering the specifics, it can be daunting and confusing when we’re suddenly asked to step back and assess the problem from a completely different perspective. Big O notation forces you to understand the code from a distance, and make a conservative estimate on how much time or space it may require. Such estimates can be expressed in mathematical notation, and ‘Big O’ specifically refers to the mathematical representation expressed by a capital Omega symbol that is used to approximate the worst case scenario.

        Big O notation is often used to compare different approaches to a problem, in order to ultimately find the most efficient approach when considering the worst case scenario.

        The topic of Big O notation comes up often in the discussion of algorithms, which again emphasizes a more generic, high-level discussion of a possible approach to solving a problem. Many patterns often occur, and often we take for granted approaches that we know or assume are more efficient than others, but it is important to know where these points come from and be able to solve for, or at least understand, Big O notation.
