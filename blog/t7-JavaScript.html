        In the past few weeks of our DBC work we've grown increasingly familiar with how to store information in Ruby coding and have been exposed to different data-storing structures. Now, in our first week of learning JavaScript, we have been introduced to common tools for coding in the JavaScript language. Right away the format of JavaScript Objects looked familiar. You state the name of an Object and then list out different pieces of data to store/associate with that particular Object name. One of the key parts to note about how you list this data, is that each data piece is labeled, so when defining an Object's stored data you end up listing out pairs of information: a label and it's data. This is strikingly similar to a Ruby Hash, where you can store values that are each labeled with a key. In both cases you can use the label/key to lookup the appropriate information in the list of data, so it's a very useful tool to keep all of the data organized. But syntactically Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects are not alike! So don't get too excited...
