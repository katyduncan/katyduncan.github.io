        Like I’ve said before, as programmers we should always be looking for ways to decrease the amount of work we have to do when writing code, especially when it comes to manually typing repetitive code over and over. Luckily, Ruby has a very helpful way to organize and reduce code. The class structure is a great tool for creating and defining methods and attributes for multiple instances of objects that share the same properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s say we want to create a type of object in Ruby called “DessertOption.” For each DessertOption you come up with, rather than repeatedly identify the properties of each one, you can define a DessertOption class that will automatically populate each of the DessertOption objects with the specified methods. For example, you probably know that each DessertOption has a “name.” Maybe you’d also like to specify that each has a “location”, a “specialty”, a “quality”, or anything else you choose! You can also choose whether you’d like each of these properties to be readable (where you can output the value that is already determined, keyword "reader"), writable (where you can input the value on the spot, keyword "writer"), or both (keyword "accessor")! Our class definition might look something like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        class DessertOption
          attr_reader :quality
          attr_accessor :location, :specialty, :price_range

          def initialize
            @quality = “Excellent”
            @location
            @specialty
            @price_range
          end

          def specialty(dessert)
            @specialty = dessert
          end
        end
      </pre>
      <p>
        Properties like location and specialty can be input with the creation of each new DessertOption. Notice that in this case the quality is predetermined to be “Excellent” regardless of which option you’re talking about (because come on, we're talking about desserts here!).
