        While many love to stereotype computer programmers as anti-social, independent techies working in isolation, descriptors such as “vocal” and “plays well with others” might not come to mind. But I’m here to spread the word, that successful programmers are in fact way more social in their work than many other professions! Every week DBC doesn’t just encourage, but actually requires us to pair up with our peers for multiple assignments.

        Pairing has a number of pros and cons. Some benefits are more obvious, like having moral support, having someone hold you accountable for completing the assingment, and having someone you can immediate direct your questions too. And there are more subtle benefits to having company while you work, like picking up keyboard tips and other shortcuts that no matter how much research you do on your own you will never learn from a textbook. There can also be a downside to pairing. Like if your partner lacks motivation and brings down your overall energy, or if your partner is further behind you in their technical skillset and you have to carry them through the assignment. But the most critical aspect of pairing is communication.

        Despite so many other factors that can affect you, the communication between you and your pair is likely the most important factor in determining whether or not your session will be successful. Whether you aren't in the mood to talk, or perhaps your pair isn't fond of speaking up, in any scenario, you have to learn how to work together and exercise your communication skills. Not only does this greatly improve the pairing process, but it is also an extremely valuable skill for all facets of life. It can be pretty unnerving not being able to predict how your pair will affect your work, but learning to cope with various unknown situations is an essential part of developing well-rounded personal growth. One of the best ways to work towards improving any situation is putting some honest thought behind what changes would be helpful, and then vocalizing those thoughts.

        For this reason, feedback is extremely important. At DBC we are required to fill out feedback surveys after every pairing session, and we in turn receive feedback from our peers. The key to providing and receiving useful feedback is making an effort to keep all feedback kind, specific, and actionable. By keeping things kind we keep the lines of communication open on both ends. We are all human, and it’s very hard not to take things personally. If feedback is rude or malicious it’s only natural that we try to protect our feelings, and put up a wall, making ourselves less receptive to what’s being said--regardless of how true the message behind it is. On the other hand, if feedback is kind but not honest or constructive, with specific things to think about, there is nothing useful to take away except a (perhaps unwarranted) confidence boost. Finally the most helpful feedback is actionable, so there are clear things to work on to make the next experience better. While it’s hard to balance not wanting to hurt someone’s feelings with maintaining an honest effort to improve ourselves as a group, the fact that we are continually receiving feedback has helped me a great deal. Seeing the thought that others have put into evaluating my work has kept me motivated to return the favor and pay it forward. In so many ways we are a team, and as we all work together to improve our team as a whole, we propel ourselves as individuals towards becoming our best.
