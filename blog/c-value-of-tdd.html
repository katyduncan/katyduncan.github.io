        It’s no secret that errors can be terrible. No matter how expert you are, no one is exempt for the sinking feeling of encountering an error in your code. Especially unexpected errors that are not immediately identifiable.
      </p>

        Test driven development has so many benefits. It can first be used as a good tool for identifying the basics of what you want your program to do. By forcing yourself to articulate these expectations in an explicit way, much like user stories, writing out tests can be a great way to keep you true to your original intentions and guide your start to building.
      </p>

        Tests can also inspire you to identify edge cases without having to learn about them the hard way. This forward thinking and anticipation can aid in thoroughly understanding the problem you’re trying to solve, as well as the behavior of the code you’re using to solve the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally, having tests set up makes maintainability and future ammendments to your code a much safer endeavor. Whether it be that your code gets passed to someone else, or your user’s needs change, code is almost always going to need to be able to adapt and change. Doing what you can now to keep your code from breaking later is often a much more efficient way to approach and set up your code well. So write tests now! They will most certainly benefit you later.
