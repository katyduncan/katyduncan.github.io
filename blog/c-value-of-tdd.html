        It’s no secret that errors can be terrible. No matter how expert you are, no one is exempt from the sinking feeling of encountering an error in your code – especially unexpected errors that are not immediately identifiable. In many ways, by the time you come face-to-face with an error message it is already too late. A mistake has already been made. And the only way to proceed is to backtrack and hope you can recount all of the places the mistake has potentially affected your code. For this reason, writing tests with the intention of staying ahead of potential errors is often a more logical approach. Many consider test-driven development to be a worthwhile safety net that deserves serious consideration from any programmer.

        Test-driven development has so many benefits. It can first be used as a good tool for identifying the basics of what you want your program to do. By forcing yourself to articulate these expectations in an explicit way, much like user stories, writing out tests can be a great way to stay true to your original intentions, and guide your start to building.
      </p>

        Tests can also inspire you to identify edge cases without having to learn from them the hard way. This forward thinking and anticipation can aid in thoroughly understanding the problem you’re trying to solve, as well as the behavior of the code you’re using to solve the problem.
      </p>

        And finally, having a testing structure in place makes maintainability and future amendments to your code a much safer endeavor. Whether it be that your code gets passed to someone else, or your user’s needs evolve, code is almost always going to need to be able to adapt and change. Doing what you can now to keep your code from breaking later is often a much more efficient way to approach and skillfully set up your code. So write tests now! They will most certainly benefit you later.
