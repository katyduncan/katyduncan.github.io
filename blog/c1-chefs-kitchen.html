  <h1>Mindsets for Dev Bootcamp</h1>
  <h2>A Fireside Chat with DBC Founder Shereef</h2>
  <h4>2/28/15</h4>

      I really like the fact that Dev Bootcamp is very open about how intimidating an experience it can be. From the beginning there has been a constant emphasis on communicating your fears, and a sort of pride in telling people that this will be excruciatingly hard and that’s ok. As my dad recently told me, “Hard is only hard.” Every time I receive one of these reminders it makes me simultaneously more excited and at ease about the entire experience.  But I can’t deny I have a lot of accompanying fear when I think about the prospect of entering such a rigorous environment. I just have to remember that behind feeling terrified I have a real desire to do this.

      In Shereef’s fireside chat he spoke about two main fears prospective students tend to have. One is imposter syndrome: that I’ll be exposed as the dumbest student in my cohort and my admission to the program was a mistake. The other is the fear that the program will be so full of beginners that they will hold me back and I’ll get bored and not be able to reach my potential or get the most out of this program.  While I for sure fall more under the first category and worry that I’ll have less relevant experience than a majority of my fellow cohorts, I do believe I can do this and just hope I remember that when things get tough later. As Shereef put it, I may have many more steps to take to get to the same end goal as my fellow cohorts, but I’m okay with that. I’ve never followed the conventional path and so far that has worked out well for me. Another piece of advice from Shereef that I’d like to hold onto is to remember that Dev Bootcamp started as, and continues to be, an experiment. My venture into web development is an experiment. I recognize that it is okay to fail. But no matter the outcome I am only going to learn (and already have learned) so much from the experience. And I think there is a big possibility that I will succeed in this program, so why not dedicate these next few months towards realizing that possibility?

      In terms of Shereef’s theory on the Kitchen vs. Restaurant mindset (or Creator vs. Consumer mindset), I definitely recognize the importance of remembering that we are all in this together, and it is up to me to make the most of my experience. While I certainly don’t feel entitled to a successful outcome, it does make me a little nervous to not have the comfort of a guaranteed future prospect come out of this. We are all sacrificing a lot of time and effort to do this program, so it’s unsettling to think about the risk of coming out with nothing to show for it.

    <p>In addition to his main discussion topics, the Q and A section of this talk led Shereef to discuss how the hardest thing to navigate at work will be relationships with coworkers. This really struck a chord with me, because in my previous work experience, when the work started to become repetitive and I started to get bored, I started to realize how true that really is. I started to have more time to pay attention to and master how to successfully navigate through various coworker relationships, and have always held on to how important that skill is, and how under-recognized the whole topic is. I just hope that as work gets more challenging (which I welcome) I won’t lose those skills in times when I can’t put as much deliberate attention towards it.
