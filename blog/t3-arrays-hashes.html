        In learning the basics of coding it has become apparent that the basic structure of coding boils down to taking “objects” and manipulating them with various types of “methods.”  It has also become apparent that there are some objects that are incredibly versatile and useful in their ability to store more than one piece of information. In Ruby in particular, arrays and hashes are incredibly important and useful objects thanks to their list-like structure. But in order to make maximum use of the two it is important to fully understand the differences between them.

      <p>
        You can think of both Arrays and Hashes as lists of stored information. But arrays are like a number-ordered list, while a hash is more like a pile of flashcards.

        Arrays are defined as a list of values, and each slot in the list has a corresponding number index. There are a number of ways to define and array, but below is one example of a common form:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          example_array = [1,’two’, 3]
        </code>
