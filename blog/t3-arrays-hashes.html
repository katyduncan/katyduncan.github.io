        In learning the fundamentals of coding (and Ruby in particular), I have found that the basic structure boils down to taking “objects” and manipulating them with various types of “methods.” It has also become apparent that some objects are extremely versatile and useful in their ability to store more than one piece of information. Namely, "Arrays" and "Hashes" are incredibly important and advantageous objects thanks to their list-like structure. But in order to get optimal use out of the two it is first important to fully understand the differences between them.

        You can think of both arrays and hashes as lists of stored information. But an array is like a number-ordered list, while a hash is more like a pile of flashcards.

      <p>
        Arrays are defined as a list of values, and each slot in the list has a corresponding number index. There are a number of ways to define and array, but below is one example of a common form:
      </p>
      <p>
        <div class ="code">
          example_array = [1,’two’, 3]
        </div>
      </p>
