        Before starting DBC we were asked to take a personal thinking style quiz to determine our Gregorc thinking style. I ended up re-taking this quiz, because I found a lot of the questions to be difficult to interpret, and I was curious to see if after 3 weeks my perspective had changed at all about my own thinking style. While I got mixed results, for the most part I think it is safe to say I am an abstract sequential thinker.

        I do not believe that I’ve fully witnessed my thinking style’s role in my experience with Dev Bootcamp thus far. Since my results were so mixed I've seen several parts of my thinking style come into play, but I expect the strongest attributes of my thinking style will become more apparent in later, more complex projects.

        I have, however, seen a lot of the power of a growth mindset, and have definitely cemented my support in it. Having a growth mindset has allowed me to read about assignments that look completely unfamiliar to me, and at times intimidating, but by approaching the challenge with an open mind I have managed to consistently complete the challenge and come out the other side with a happily confident understanding of brand new material.
