        When asked to think about one of the values that has defined me in the past and continues to be important to me in the present, the keyword "Ambition" sticks with me. I think my ambition has driven me through a lot of past successes, and to this day it continues to remind me and motivate me to realize what I am capable of.

      <p>
        I think ambition is an accurate word to use, because to me it has a positive connotation, and I've always been driven by an optimistic energy. At the same time it has a sense of work put in, and I think that holds true for my desire to reach goals that require an appropriate amount of effort in order for results to follow. And I think ambition respresnts a healthy amount of self-confidence balanced with idealism that pushes me to go for things.

      <p>
        Whenever advising someone I always try to push people to go for things even if success doesn't seem like a guaranteed or even likely thing. I never followed a "conventional" path to any of my greatest accomplishments and I'm grateful that the "norm" didn't stop me from pursuing those achievments. For one thing, the safe path isn't even a guarantee in itself most of the time. And, for another, I don't think many people are able to predict the best things that have happened to them. Whether an experience is good or bad is not something you can know ahead of time. So you may as well go for things -- if anything for the life experience, but by doing so with ambition you can maximize the results for yourself, whatever they may be.
