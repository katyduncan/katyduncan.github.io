  <h1>Introduction to Git (and GitHub)</h1>
  <h2>What is Git and why use it?</h2>

      I’ll admit I was a little disheartened to find that I couldn’t look over my Week 1 curriculum for Dev Bootcamp without getting hung up on the title: “Git, GitHub, and the Command Line.” From my limited computer science experience the command line sounded familiar to me, but what are Git and GitHub? A quick definition of Git is that it is a version control software. But what does that mean? Luckily the concept is pretty simple, and has very useful applications across a wide range of areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control allows you to save any changes to a file as new versions of the file, so you can keep track of all changes, and revert back to previous versions at any time. Not only that, but it allows for multiple users to work on the same file simultaneously and then merge changes into one copy of the file.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are so many benefits to this type of software. In my previous work experience we ran into several instances where a version control software like Git would have been so helpful. Our work required performing analyses in excel files, putting together client-ready reports in powerpoint, as well as writing reports to be published in Word documents. We worked in small teams and had to work together on files across all of these applications. But without a version control software we were stuck looking at a file one at a time, saving the file multiple times and having to rename each new version with a v1, v2, etc. at the end of the file name so we could keep each file straight. Or we had to each work on multiple copies of a word document and merge changes to a master file manually. We had to put in so much extra work in order to work together, and it was at times a struggle to keep everything organized. But a version control software like Git does all of this work for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Git you can work on your own copy of a file, regardless of who else is working on the same project. Then when you are ready to submit your changes you “stage” your version of the file (which essentially preps Git for an upcoming new version of the file – a middle step that gives you an opportunity to retract your changes before you submit them) and then “commit” the changed version to the file (a step where Git keeps track of who submitted changes when, and where you can add a label and explain the changes associated with the updated version). By “commiting” through Git you can always access a “log” that contains the history of the file.  You can easily see every change that all users have submitted and you have the ability to revert back to a previous version in case a mistake or bug has slipped into the file. And Git’s merging capabilities takes care of merging your (and other users’) changes to the “master branch” version of the file for you. So it is always keeping the master copy of the file organized among the many moving parts.
    </p>

        GitHub is essentially an online file storage facility through which you can use the version control powers of Git to create projects as smoothly as possible. The fact that GitHub is online makes it the perfect place to store your code so you can access it from anywhere with an internet connection. It also stores your code on an open domain where other GitHub users have access to your files, allowing them to look over and suggest changes to your code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all, both Git and GitHub are useful tools for creating and sharing files (and code in particuluar) and it is very clear to me now why they are so popular. I’m glad to have been introduced to them and look forward to making good use of them in the future!
