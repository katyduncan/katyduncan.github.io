        Piggybacking off of one of my earlier blogs, communication is key. Especially in tech, where we are seemingly always caught cutting corners in human-to-human communication.  Even with the best intentions, we have difficulty helping each other, often because we aren’t clear in expressing our needs. So we should return to the basics. Before tyring to analyze whether or not someone was helpful in trying to help you, we should first examine whether we’ve asked for help in the right way. We should analyze the source or prompt before we can accurately assess the results. And so, we have to ask ourselves, how does one ask for help? How does one formulate a good question? How can we ensure that we’re best expressing ourselves to others, so that they may help us to the best of their ability, and we are all proceeding in as successful a manner as possible.

        In my opinion a good question is often calm. A good question is thought-through. And a good question is specific. Following this process usually forces you to assess the problem in a more thorough way, and infact you may end up clarifying things for yourself, eliminating the need for help. By not being overly reliant on others, and by not cutting corners in communication, we all become better learners.
