        No matter where I am in life, no matter what field, I always see that everyone wants to collect people's thoughts on conflict resolution. In my recent life, I’ve seen conflict arise in tech most commonly in working with others. But what I’ve also noticed is that what is often perceived as conflict is not necessarily a disagreement. People might assume that a conflict infers a discord in understanding of and/or approach to an assignment. Rather I’ve found that conflict can usually be attributed to an underlying neglected internal pressure revealing itself outwardly, and is not in fact a true misunderstanding between parties.

        So often I find that when conflict arises, the most likely solution lies in self assessment. I’ve found that I experience conflict as a tightening feeling in my throat and I feel a lack of ability to get my thoughts through to the other person clearly. I start to feel an agitation that neither person is backing down and/or submitting to the other person’s side of the argument. But this is a blind tension. What we see as not agreeing is actually an issue from a deeper root in the communication line that we failed to address clearly.

        For example, when you are tryng to describe your vision for a wireframe for a website to someone: you say a box on the side, they say oh yes like this, you say no that’s not a box on the side, they say that’s what you asked for, etc. But the original issue wasn't necessarily that either person is "doing it wrong". The issue was in the choice of words, or in a failure to clarify each other's interpretations, not actually a disagreement in how the website should look.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when conflicts arise, I find it best to take a step back and reevaluate how each party is communicating. Having differing thoughts doesn't have to be an argument if both parties have been clearly articulating and listening to each other's thoughts. If both parties are following along in the conversation then bumps in the road are little and can be navigated around peacefully, rather than emotionally driven collisions.
