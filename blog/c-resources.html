        As I examine my experience at DBC, I’m constantly looking at it in contrast to the world outside of DBC. If I were doing this work myself outside of DBC, how much more would I struggle. When I do my own work at DBC, why is it so accelerated relative to my non-DBC self? Are these lessons not replicable outside of DBC? Are these ideas not expressed outside of DBC? What makes DBC so special, that the learning process is so much more efficient and effective? Recognizing the importance and uniqueness of the resources we’ve encountered in this learning process is hugely important in acknowledging the benefits and successes of learning to code here.

        We have teachers, TAs, peers, coaches, alums… Websites, forums, documentation… Newsletters, news articles, books…. All of these resources are infinitely available, immeasurably informative, and have not only taught us what we’re learning, but, in recognizing their presence, have taught us how to learn and set us up for ongoing, successful futures in tech.
