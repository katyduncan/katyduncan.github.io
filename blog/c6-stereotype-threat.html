        I am a logical person. Even in emotional situations I take comfort in being able to reason with myself and settle my feelings logically. For this reason I feel like the concept of stereotype threat shouldn’t affect me. But I have to acknowledge that I have in fact experienced its effects firsthand.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first looked over the definition of stereotype threat (the idea that people perform more poorly when they believe they are stereotypically perceived to be expected to perform poorly, and in their fear of fulfilling/validate the stereotype end up impeding their ability and in fact performing more poorly), I didn’t think it applied to me. I have always been aware of how privileged I’ve been to have grown up in an environment where I always felt safe and never faced adversity. Especially in high school, where I attended school with such a diverse group of people, I became even more aware of a wide range of perspectives of different minority groups, and knew I never had a right to complain. That’s why it surprised me to see that one of the main examples of stereotype threat was actually about me!
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though growing up and all the way through high school I felt safe and in fact privileged, I unexpectedly encountered a more judgmental environment with a seemingly less mature perspective after graduating high school. It was in college that I ended up finding myself to be a prime test subject for the concept of stereotype threat. Apart from the new friends and fun experiences I encountered, a majority of my college experience was based on being a girl in the math department at the University of Chicago.

        While it was never any secret that I was a girl, the criticism of my interests was new to me. The fact that I excelled in math and was something I was only ever encouraged to pursue. Upon my arrival at college I started to recognize that there was a huge leap in perception from high school where a lot of my female friends also thrived in math. I didn’t realize it was an unusual path. Up until then I didn’t think anything of it. In fact, as I was choosing my major I knew I had several high school friends making the same decision to major in math, at other schools around the country, so I felt I was merely joining the club. I had a community in mind of other girls like me that I could always relate to.

        While it was never any secret that I was a girl, the criticism of my interests was new to me. The fact that I excelled in math and was something I was only ever encouraged to pursue. Upon my arrival at college I started to recognize that there was a huge leap in perception from high school where a lot of my female friends also thrived in math. I had been completely unaware that it was considered to be an unusual path. In fact, as I was choosing my major I knew I had several high school friends making the same decision to major in math, at other schools around the country, so I felt I was merely joining the club. I had a community in mind of other girls like me that I could always relate to. So when I ended up with not only an unexpected spotlight on my back as I walked the math department’s hallways, but a negative reaction that followed me around campus when I would tell people what my major was, I was even more sensitive and hyper-aware of the stereotypes being projected onto me.

        I question whether the presence of these stereotypes actually affected the quality of my performance in school but it is too difficult to know for sure. I know it certainly affected my attitude towards math during my time at school. I felt compelled to hide or at least avoid discussion of my interest in math with others. While it is difficult to distinguish the true source of my attitude, I didn’t enjoy completing the math degree as a younger version of myself would have envisioned. I felt stressed at all times, and felt like I just wanted to survive and complete it. I didn’t want to spend any extra time in the math building than I had to. Luckily, once I came out the other end, I have rediscovered the joy in solving math problems. But there are so many circumstances that are different for me now. I have had the luxury of time to think for myself and choose how I spend my time. And while I could consider my time in college is kind of a dark, stressful period, I held a sort of pride throughout that I was surviving this tough environment. I feel like I came out of it with much more pride and sense of achievement than if I had chosen an easier path.

      <p>I think that surviving as a woman in math makes the prospect of being a woman in tech less daunting. My attraction to computer science in general doesn’t feel far off from what appeals to me about math.  One of the cool things about coding is that it can be somewhat anonymous. When you read code you don’t necessarily have a picture in mind of the person who wrote it. While I was unconscious of it at the time, I think part of my draw to mathematics was that it is a universal language where the work can speak for itself. While I was always proud of my work and what I was able to accomplish, I was glad my work could speak for itself. Though it is disappointing I think that it became true for me that I started to feel that I was lucky the work could speak for itself because I didn’t want to draw attention to the type of person that was behind the work. While I was sad to see myself start to want my work to be anonymous in college, I think the benefits of coding work being universal has really cool implications.

        I am hopeful in that I don’t anticipate that my gender will impact my performance in programming. On a personal note I think half the battle is becoming aware of a possible reaction to the environment on my part, and that has already led me to a strong decision not to let the environment have an impact on me. But also I think in general there is much more communication and there are many more discussions in the tech community that make for increased visibility of this issue, so I feel like companies have to be accountable for acknowledging, addressing, and avoiding this issue. Also I think that practices in the cycle of academic math have been unchanged for years, whereas the tech world is always changing, updating, responding to trends, and the spotlight on company diversity and promoting women in tech actually seems to be advantageous.

        And finally, in my work so far I feel like I’ve been thriving. I know when I understand something and I know when I don’t. So far I’ve been understanding things and I’m happy to share that and show off when that is the case. There can be a lot of talk and attempt to intimidate but that has never blocked me from being able to dig past the outer cloud of noise and pinpoint the basic, concrete problem to solve, solve it, and then when I have my solution get back into the social realm and express it. I strive at all times to keep a level head, and stay collected and rational. And rationally, I do not see a reason for my gender to affect my ability to express my work through a computer.
