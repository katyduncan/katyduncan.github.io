        In the last week I came across two tech articles that caught my eye, in particular because they both had the key word “fail” in their titles. The first was an opinion piece highlighting the cynical side of the public’s view of a tech giant titled, “Why we need Apple to fail.” The article explored a few theories but in the end determined that we need Apple to fail because it is seen as a super-human powerhouse that we are all desperate to bring down to a human level. The second article was a recap on the keynote speech Google X exec Dr. Astro Teller gave at SXSW and had a much more positive spin on failure. “We need to fail faster” discussed Google’s approach to testing ideas to reach success quickly. It focused on how Google’s ability to run with an idea full speed ahead, regardless of the outcome, is what makes the company successful. Google emphasizes that this means running with bad ideas and reaching their failed endpoints as often as possible, in order to make progress towards an amazing success that lies beyond. This idea of climbing past the failures in order to succeed is not entirely unfamiliar.

        I think both of these articles stood out to me because DBC has taken every opporutnity to tell us we should not be afraid of failure.  In the world of technology one is constantly faced with the question of whether or not it is ok to fail. I like that these two pieces described the differing views of failure in the tech world between the public on the outside and the successful companies on the inside. I think the story about Google credits the company's successful strategy taking this idea to heart and illustrates that the simple idea of not being afraid to fail and allowing it to play out in the real world on a large scale can lead to amazing achievements. By the same token I think society in general tends to be afraid of failure, and by not seeing Apple openly testing ideas and failing in the public eye the outside community has put a barrier between the public and Apple. But I think that in fact Apple must be testing ideas and seeing them fail all the time, it is just something that's going on behind closed doors. The relationship between public opinion of Apple and the reality of what it takes to be successful is one we’ve had to think about a lot in DBC's cultural lessons. Many people outside of the tech world idealize the successful results of hi-tech products without seeing the steps it took to get there, and as a result people distance themselves from the end product because they believe they themselves would fail before creating such an incredible product. But it took humans to reach that point! We need to all get over our fear of failure; because the reality is that the people succeeding in technology are reaching their success by working through failures to reach their goals. The big tech forces we see are not super-human, but are in fact driven by humans who are not afraid to fail.
