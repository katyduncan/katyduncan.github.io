        I’m taking the Stanford Algorithms course with my boyfriend, a current Stanford PhD candidate in Fluid Mechanics. While our specialties are varied, I was confident we both met any prerequisites for taking the course, and I thought it would be fun to have an in-person companion for the class and have someone to keep me accountable. Not only that, but in signing myself up to assist someone else through such a technical class, I figured I’d reinforce an important foundation of skills and really cement them for myself. I’ve quickly found though how much we have both learned from each other. Not only are our skillsets somewhat complimentary for this course, but I’ve found that in general, working with someone who comes from a completely different background widens my perspective, encourages that I clarify my own knowledge by being forced to express it to others, and offers perspective on how applicable the very basic levels of these concepts are to so many different areas of study/real life.

        We all have so much we can learn from each other. We should keep the lines of communication flowing between all fields.  Humanizing tech and seeing how understandable and useful it is to others makes me love it that much more.
