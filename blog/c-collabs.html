        In order to build a stronger foundation and vocabulary for approaching algorithms in programming, I’m taking the Stanford Algorithms course online through Coursera. I also convinced my boyfriend, a current Stanford PhD candidate in Fluid Mechanics to take the course with me. While our specialties are varied, I was confident we both met any prerequisites for taking the course, and I thought it would be fun to have an in-person companion for the class and have someone to keep me accountable. Not only that, but in signing myself up to assist someone else through such a technical class, I figured I’d reinforce and cement an important set of skills for myself. I’ve quickly found, though, that we've both already learned a significant amount from each other. Not only are our skillsets somewhat complimentary for this course, but I’ve found that in general, working with someone who comes from a completely different background widens my perspective, encourages that I clarify my own knowledge in order to express it to others, and offers perspective on how applicable the very basic levels of these concepts are to so many different areas of study/real life. We all have so much we can learn from each other. We should keep the lines of communication flowing between all fields.

        I've recognized that the feeling of not being alone when embarking on an endeavor (in this case completing programming problem sets) helps relieve stress, which leads to a more condusive mindset for sharper thinking, a more productive work process, and a more successful outcome. I've also noticed that in walking through our separate codes together and translating (literally, because we are writing our codes in different languages) our thoughts to one another, we recognize that we are both human, and that comes with both the good (sometimes unique, clever, and inspiring ideas I wouldn't have thought of myself) and the bad (catching errors for each other both in logic and in syntax). But seeing this level of humanization, especially in tech, and witnessing how understandable and usefl it is to others makes me love it and the process of applying code to problem-solving makes me love it that much more.
