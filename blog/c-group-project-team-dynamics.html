        As team lead for our DBC final projects, Iâ€™ve been paying particular attention to how best to set up a good team dynamic to ensure the best work and most positive experience possible. Being aware of and hyper-senstive to potential issues down the road and addressing defense plans in advance has been extremely beneficial. This can start with establishing such seemingly basic things as the team mission statement, project description, and team values. Already we have revisited these statements multiple times as a way to re-calibrate during fast-paced workdays. Also, by agreeing to be flexible, these statements and guidelines exist without the threat of failing to meet them as individuals, but in a more pleasant way to provide a good standard of accountability for ourselves and often they serve as more of a tool of comfort than an assignment.
