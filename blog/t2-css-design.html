        Consider an object on a webpage. It can be an image, a body of text, a link, etc. How does a web developer describe the space around that object?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the basic things you can think about in terms of design is the placement of the object on the web page, a possible border around the object, and many more details. But for now letâ€™s focus on the three main spatial terms that we deal with in web design: margin, border, and padding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a simply image illustrating the relationship between these three characteristics:

      </p>
      <p>
        Setting these parameters is fairly straight forward in CSS with code defined in the following format:
        insert sample code...
      </p>
      <p>
        Closing paragraph...
      </p>

      <!-- copy and paste as many sections as you want to add paragraphs -->
    </div>
  </section>
</main>
